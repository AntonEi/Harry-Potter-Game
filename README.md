  - Dobby's Movement: Verified that Dobby moves towards Harry as expected.

### Fixed Bugs

#### Double Points on Incorrect Quiz Answer

- When a user guessed the quiz question wrong, the game was restarting twice, resulting in double points being awarded.
- The issue was identified in the restartHarryGame function, specifically in the points calculation logic.
- The initialScore was being incremented on every restart, leading to the double points bug.
- To resolve this, the points increment logic was removed from the restartHarryGame function.

#### Game Continues After Dobby Hits Harry

- Previously, when the game restarted after Dobby hit Harry, the game did not stop. This led to unexpected behavior and a lack of synchronization between the game restart and the end condition.
- The issue was identified in the youLose function, responsible for handling the game-over condition.
- The clearInterval(checkDead); statement was not effectively stopping the game loop, allowing the game to continue.

### Known Bugs
